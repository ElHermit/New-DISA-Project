Project Creator will actually be directory creator
ClientProject class will be in charge of actually adding resources

at the begining we have to create the new directory

then we poll the user on what they need, calling the directory class if needed

Create menu selector static clas
	- this way we only have to call a specific method if a chosen option is selected

	- Arguments
		- array of options
		- array of corresponding methods

Perhaps have predetermined directories
	- then we can copy the whole directory depending on what we need
